Phase1.java:  Deleted all of the processes that went inside of methods, and returned Type and List<Type> for others

Typechecker.java: Printed what was inside the ClassVarMap and Method List to test if the right information was stored.  Filled in all the methods to throw a TypecheckerError if an error was found.

Method.java: Wrote an Equals method that checked if two different method objects were equal (had the same name and parameter types)

ArrayType.java: Made it take a parameter that was its base type.  Acknowledged the base type and pointers in the toString() method
