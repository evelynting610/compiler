Format of .icode1 files:

---First line has three tokens:
	---the string "icode1"

	---the basename of the original source code file.  

		(If the first phase of the compiler was invoked with the line
			java FrontEnd tests/MyTest.java
		
		the basename is "tests/MyTest", and the second call should be
			java BackEnd  tests/MyTest.icode1
		
		Compiler writers can, of course, use other names instead of FrontEnd and
		Backend.

	---the name of the architecture (e.g. linux) used in the front end.

---Zero or more lines describing string literals.  Each line should contain:
	---the string "string"

	---the label (e.g. L20) assigned to the string

	---the string literal.  It should follow the string literal format used
		in the target assembly language, including quotation marks.

---Zero or more lines describing global variables.  Each line should contain:
	---the string "globalVar"
	---the label for the global variable

---A line giving the name of the main method.  It should contain:
	---the string "mainMethod"
	---the label for the main method

---Intermediate code for the methods.  The first line for each method should contain
	---the string "method"
	---the label of the method
	---the label of the Stm node (e.g. Stm175) at the root of the intermediate code tree
	---architecture-dependent information about the frame.  This could contain, for example,
		the number of parameters for the method

	It is assumed that the entry point for the method is at the beginning of the intermediate
	code and that the exit point is at the end.

---The body of each method is described by a sequence of lines describing the nodes in the
	intermediate tree.  The nodes must be listed based on a preorder traveral of the tree.
	This implies that the description of the root appears last.

---Each line of intermediate code consists of a label, a colon, a node type, and operands.  For
	example:
		Exp244 : ESEQ Stm151 Exp254

	Calls to the icode() method in the various subclasses of Tree.Stm and Tree.Exp will produce
	correctly formatted lines.

---Each method ends with a line containing the string "endMethod".
